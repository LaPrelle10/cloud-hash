# cloud-hash
Cloud-hash built using http://heroku.com/ a work in-progress featured system for cloud mining and data storage with folder space and hashrate. User 
hashrate for mining speed is depended on the type of mining rig there using , mining algorithms are SHA-256 or etash or X11 are the mining algorithms being
used for "cloud-hash". System functions are as general which is fan control and speed notifcations are being accessed for user use. Allowed choice of 
crypto pools and address for mining storage space is a virtual container made from a api connection with a splitter for second access to container 
filled with bandwidth and cpu core processor with be the mining rigs speed. Balance will be held outside of the pool for intial crypto balance 
being more or less a verison which users see a funing amount limitaions are based on the TB or GB size of pool being minined from without 
any limits you'll have a better success rate to mining hashrate. Filled pools should be minied from at a low TH PH rate of hash for smaller blocksize 
reducing diffcultly limiting cpu burnouts on your processor rather than your gpu mining.
