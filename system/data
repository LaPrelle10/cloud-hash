# Data Mining System

# Intel. 
  To create a model, the algorithm first analyzes the data you provide, looking for specific types of patterns or trends. 
 The algorithm uses the results of this analysis over many iterations to find the optimal parameters for creating the mining model. 
 These parameters are then applied across the entire data set to extract actionable patterns and detailed statistics.
 
1. A set of clusters that describe how the cases in a dataset are related.

2. A decision tree that predicts an outcome, and describes how different criteria affect that outcome.

3. A mathematical model that forecasts sales.

4. A set of rules that describe how products are grouped together in a transaction, and the probabilities that products are purchased together.
The algorithms provided in SQL Server Data Mining are the most popular, well-researched methods of deriving patterns from data. 
To take one example, K-means clustering is one of the oldest clustering algorithms and is available widely in many different tools and with many 
different implementations and options. However, the particular implementation of K-means clustering used in SQL Server Data Mining was developed by Microsoft
Research and then optimized for performance with Analysis Services. All of the Microsoft data mining algorithms can be extensively customized and are fully
programmable, using the provided APIs. You can also automate the creation, training, and retraining of models by using the data mining components in
Integration Services.

You can also use third-party algorithms that comply with the OLE DB for Data Mining specification, or develop custom algorithms that can be 
registered as services and then used within the SQL Server Data Mining framework.
